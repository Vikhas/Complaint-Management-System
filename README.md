# Complaint Management System

## Overview

This project automates the process of raising complaints by users, maintaining a clear hierarchy for raising, upvoting, authorizing, and providing solutions to complaints. It transforms the traditional method of maintaining complaint records and raising petitions into an automated system.

The system is developed using Node.js, HTML, CSS, MongoDB, and Passport for authentication. Handlebars is used as the template engine.

- **Hierarchical Workflow**: Maintains a clear hierarchy for complaints, including upvoting, authorization, and resolution.
- **User Authentication**: Secured with Passport for managing user access and roles.
- **Template Engine**: Uses Handlebars for dynamic and efficient rendering of views.
